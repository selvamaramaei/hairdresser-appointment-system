Project Requirements
Project Goal
The goal of the project is to apply the theoretical and practical knowledge learned in the Web Programming course to solve a real-world problem by developing a web project.

Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a salon management application for a Hairdresser/Beauty salon (women) and Barber (men) using ASP.NET Core MVC. The system will define the services offered by the salons, their duration and cost, the areas of expertise and availability of the employees, and allow users to book appointments with available employees. This will enable tracking of employee productivity and daily earnings. Additionally, the project will use a REST API for database communication, and artificial intelligence integration will allow users to upload photos and receive hairstyle or color suggestions.

Concept and Requirements
1. Hairdresser/Barber Definitions
The application should support defining both hairdresser and barber salons with appropriate authorization.
The services offered by each salon, their duration, and pricing should be clearly defined according to the salon's working hours.
2. Employee Management
Employees working in the salons should be registered in the system.
Each employee's areas of expertise and the services they can perform should be defined.
The availability of employees should be specified so that users can book appointments during those times.
3. Appointment System
Users should be able to book appointments with available employees based on the services and times they offer.
If the selected appointment time is not available due to conflicting appointments, the system should issue a warning.
Appointment details (service, duration, and cost) will be stored in the system.
A confirmation mechanism should be in place for appointments.
4. REST API Usage
At least one part of the project should use a REST API to communicate with the database.
5. Artificial Intelligence Integration
The project should integrate a feature powered by artificial intelligence.
Users will be able to upload a photo to receive hairstyle or color suggestions through AI.
Note: For a more in-depth analysis, you may consult with a hairdressing salon.
